# Background
A minimal ml system that lets you ask questions against your own notes, documents, or articles and nothing else.

## personal-knowledge-Index
1. You provide documents
2. They are chunked
3. Chunks are embedded
4. A question retrieves the most relevant chunks
5. The model answers using only those chunks

## Out of Scope (Explicit Non-Goals)
Not a chatbot
Not connected to the internet
Not trained on external data
Not a productivity app
